**Author**: James Brooks
**Version**: 1.0.0
<!-- (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission) -->

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This API is a simple one that draws from a currently limited pool of data in the form of a JSON file to return the date and a description of the weather for 3 pre-determined dates in 3 pre-determined cities.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
To get this API working you need `cors`, `dotenv`, `axios` and `express` installed as dependencies.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This app uses Node, and Express at base; and uses the libraries of DotENV, Cors, Axios, and NodeMon.
